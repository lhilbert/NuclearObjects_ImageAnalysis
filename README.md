 MatLab scripts for image analysis of objects inside cell nuclei

Currently, the repository contains the scripts for extracting and analyzing Nikon .nd2 files with multiple XY positions in them.

To use the scripts, you will first have to download bfmatlab, and add it to your MatLab path.

Adding a directory to the MatLab path permanently:

You will also need the Image Processing toolbox. The Parallel toolbox is helpful, as it can speed up your image processing.
